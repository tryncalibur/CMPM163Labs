Cube 1: Texture 197 with normals using three.js

Cube 2: Texture 197 w/o normals using three.js

Cube 3: Texture 200 with normals from texture 194 using three.js

Cube 4: Texture 165 using own shaders

Cube 5: Texture 165 using own shaders tiled by taking uv coords and multiplying by 2, then subtracting 1 if value > 1
	This was accomplished by multiplying the UV coordinates by two, then subtracting 1 if the values becomes greater than 1 so that the uv doesn't repeat the last value



Question 24:
a) x = 7(u)
b) y = 7 - 7(v)
c) Reddish - Orange
